// MUST be the very first import in main.ts, before anything that pulls in
// @huggingface/transformers.
//
// Why this exists: in Obsidian's Electron renderer, `process.release.name` is
// "node", so transformers.js computes IS_NODE_ENV = true (once, at import time:
// `process?.release?.name === "node"`) and selects the onnxruntime-NODE backend.
// But onnxruntime-node is externalised — no native binding loads in the renderer —
// so its InferenceSession is undefined. The first pipeline() call then throws
// "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'create')", and because the Node
// branch is taken, the supported-device list is built for Node too, so "webgpu"
// and "wasm" are later rejected as unsupported ("Should be one of: .").
//
// We are really in a browser-like renderer (DOM + WebGPU + WASM are all present),
// so the WEB backend is the correct one: transformers' bundled onnxruntime-web,
// with a real device list of [webgpu?, wasm]. transformers decides node-vs-web
// exactly once, from `process.release.name`, at the moment its backend module is
// imported. We flip that single value to a non-"node" string just for that import,
// then restore it on the next microtask — which runs only after the whole
// synchronous module-eval (transformers included) has finished, so IS_NODE_ENV is
// already captured and nothing else ever observes the change.
//
// NOTE: an earlier approach installed onnxruntime-web under
// Symbol.for("onnxruntime"). transformers checks that symbol FIRST and, when
// present, uses it as the runtime but skips building the device list entirely —
// leaving supportedDevices empty, so every device threw "Should be one of: .".
// Flipping IS_NODE_ENV instead takes the real web branch, which both selects
// onnxruntime-web AND populates the device list.
//
// SECOND, SEPARATE Node check: onnxruntime-web's Emscripten wasm glue decides
// node-vs-web with `process.versions.node && process.type != "renderer"`. In
// Obsidian's renderer `process.type` is NOT "renderer", so the glue concludes
// Node and `import()`s the Node-only `worker_threads` module → "Failed to resolve
// module specifier 'worker_threads'" / "no available backend found". This check
// runs at session-create time (embed), long after the microtask above restored
// release.name, and it reads process.type (not release.name) — so we must fix it
// separately. We ARE in an Electron renderer, so set process.type to its correct
// value, persistently, before any embedding runs.
