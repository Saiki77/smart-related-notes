# How Smart Related Notes works

A deep dive into the techniques behind the plugin: how a note becomes a set of
vectors, how related notes are ranked, and where it is heading next. Everything runs
**locally and offline** in Obsidian's renderer (transformers.js on onnxruntime-web,
WASM by default); no note ever leaves your vault and the only network traffic is the
one-time model-weights download.

## 1. Chunking — structure-aware, idea-first

A note is not embedded as one blob. It is split along its **own structure** so that
matching can happen at the right granularity:

1. **Sections** — `splitIntoSections` walks the raw markdown and cuts at ATX headings
   (`#`..`######`), carrying a heading breadcrumb. It is code-fence and frontmatter
   aware, so a `#` inside a code block is never mistaken for a heading. Inline markdown
   in the heading (`**bold**`, `[[links]]`) is stripped so the breadcrumb is clean.
2. **Passages** — each section is split into paragraphs, then into ~80-word sentence
   windows (`windowSentences`, one-sentence overlap), and finally each window is held
   under a hard character budget (`splitToBudget`, ~480 chars ≈ 120 tokens) so the
   embedding model never silently truncates a chunk. This is what keeps German
   compounds and long sentences in-distribution.
3. **Ideas** — `assignIdeas` groups consecutive passages into coherent **idea units**
   of roughly 200-500 words. Boundaries are placed at heading transitions and at
   **lexical-cohesion valleys** (a drop in shared content words between neighbours),
   bounded by size rails, with an **atomic-note guard** (short notes stay a single
   idea) and a merge-small pass (no orphan one-sentence "ideas"). A paragraph is a poor
   unit for an idea; this recovers the idea as the user actually thinks of it.

## 2. Embeddings — multi-granularity, two model strategies

Every note is represented at more than one level so a relationship can be found whether
it lives in the whole note or in a single idea.

- **Windowed strategy (default, MiniLM/mpnet/e5):** the note is a title chunk plus the
  passage windows above. The note's overall vector is the L2-normalized mean of its
  passage vectors.
- **Whole-note strategy (jina-v5, opt-in):** because jina has an 8192-token context,
  the note's overall vector is a **single embed of the whole note** (its strongest
  signal), and each **idea is embedded whole** as a chunk. The idea extractor is reused
  to find the boundaries; jina just embeds the full idea rather than 480-char windows.

Storage is dimension-agnostic and tuned for large vaults:

- Chunk vectors are **int8-quantized** (with per-row scales) and expanded back to fp32
  **lazily** through an LRU cache, only when a note enters a Stage-2 shortlist. The
  overall vector is kept as fp32.
- **Mean-centering**: embedding spaces are anisotropic — unrelated notes still score a
  high baseline cosine. The plugin subtracts the corpus centroid from every vector at
  rank time, so unrelated notes sit near 0 and a `~0.2` cutoff cleanly separates the
  genuinely related ones.
- Frontmatter **tags and aliases are folded into the embed input** (not just the body),
  so a note's category and alternate names influence its vector.

### Why the model choice is what it is

The default is a **paraphrase (symmetric)** model on purpose. Note-to-note relatedness
is a symmetric problem, and a measured A/B on a real vault (link-recall against the
user's own `[[wikilinks]]` as ground truth) found:

| model / strategy | recall@10 |
| --- | --- |
| jina-v5-nano, whole-note | **0.52** |
| MiniLM-L12, windows (default) | 0.43 |
| BGE-M3, windows | 0.35 |
| BGE-M3, whole-note | 0.21 |

Two takeaways: (1) **retrieval models** (BGE-M3, e5) tuned for short-query→document
rank symmetric note similarity *worse*, not better; (2) embedding a whole note as one
long vector only wins with a model actually built for long context (**jina-v5** does;
BGE-M3 does not). jina is opt-in because it is a larger (~250 MB) non-commercial
(CC-BY-NC) download; the default stays small, fast, and permissively licensed.

## 3. Ranking — a multi-stage funnel

For the active note, every other note is scored by a funnel that spends cheap compute
widely and expensive compute narrowly:

1. **Stage 1 — shortlist.** Cosine of the centered overall vectors. Cheap (one dot per
   note), so it runs over the whole vault and keeps the top candidates.
2. **Stage 2 — fine match.** Over the shortlist only, **bidirectional MaxSim** (`biMax`):
   the symmetric max cosine across the two notes' chunk vectors, with the title chunk
   weighted higher. This is what lets a note related by *one* idea or passage surface
   even when its overall topic differs.
3. **Idea blend.** An optional idea-level signal (`ideaInfluence`) mixes "do these notes
   share a whole idea" into the score — a live knob, no re-index.
4. **Structural boost.** Direct links (either direction), shared tags, and recency nudge
   the score; a `minSimilarity` floor drops the long tail.

## 4. Beyond pure similarity

- **Isolated areas** — activate a tag namespace (e.g. `goa`) and that area becomes a
  self-contained partition: its notes only relate to each other and never appear in any
  other note's cards. A self-contained world or novel stays self-contained.
- **Vault insights** (command) — a report built from the index: the strongest
  **related-but-unlinked** pairs (grow a sparse graph), **orphan** notes (no links in or
  out, each with its closest relative), near-**duplicates**, and **suggested tags**
  inferred by **label propagation** (a note missing a tag most of its semantic
  neighbours carry).
- **Linked-notes mode** — a panel toggle that shows what the active note links to (a
  map-of-content's members), the structural complement to similarity.
- **Search** — the sidebar search ranks by best-passage match plus a title/tag boost,
  not just the note average, and inherits whichever model is active.

## 5. Roadmap — tag-free concept search

The hardest open problem: a query like "characters" or "locations" should return the
**member** notes, and it must work even when the user has no tags, no map-of-content
notes, and no useful link graph — by inferring the latent category from the vault's own
patterns. The intended approach is a **multi-stage embedding** pipeline:

1. embed the concept query and coarse-retrieve;
2. **pseudo-relevance feedback** — refine the query toward the centroid of its top hits,
   pulling in the rest of the latent cluster (the other locations) even though none of
   them say "I am a location";
3. **latent clustering / prototype scoring** — rank by *membership* in the discovered
   cluster, not just raw similarity to the word.

Tags, links, and hubs, when present, only sharpen this; the content-only path is the
baseline. This is in design, not yet shipped.
